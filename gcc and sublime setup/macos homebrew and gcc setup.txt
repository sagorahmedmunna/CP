// step 1: install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


-> step 2: after installing homebrew you will see some commands to your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH, just copy and run those commands
-> for me, I had this three commands for example:
  echo >> /Users/sagorahmedmunna/.zprofile
  echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/sagorahmedmunna/.zprofile
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

-> step 3: install gcc
brew install gcc


-> step 4: install gtimeout
brew install coreutils

## now you are done.


// build this in sublime
{
  "cmd" : ["g++-15 $file_name -o $file_base_name && gtimeout 6s ./$file_base_name<input.txt>output.txt"], 
  "selector" : "source.c",
  "shell": true,
  "working_dir" : "$file_path"
}
